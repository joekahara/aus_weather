[x] pick a few locations to build models for
[x] use one-hot encoding
[x] for each location, sort data chronologically and take first 80% for training and last 20% for testing
[x] only use date for splitting dataset

could also do season-based experiment by splitting into seasons

for extra validation, can do 50% tr 50% test, then 60% tr 40% test, etc. up to 95% and 5%

add feature selection if possible
