An analysis of historical meteorological data from various locations in Australia spanning from 2007-2017. 

The class, 'RainTomorrow' will be predicited by various machine learning models based on features like temperature, sunshine, humidity, and cloud cover. The data will be split into chronological sections at multiple ratios to create the testing and training sets, to see the effects of the amount of data gathered on the model performance. Models will be developed for subsets of the original dataset that are separated by distinct location, so that the model will be more performative for each specific location considered.
